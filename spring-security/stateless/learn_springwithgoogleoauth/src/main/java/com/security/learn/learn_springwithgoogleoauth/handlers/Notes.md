The difference is **predictability and user experience**. While the `SavedRequest` redirect works, it can land your user on a raw backend API page instead of your React UI. Forcing a redirect to your React app ensures the user always has a consistent experience.

Mawa, you are right. That flow *does* work. But now, think about the user experience.

### ## The Two Scenarios: Why an Explicit Redirect is Better

Let's compare two different ways a user might log in.

#### **Scenario 1 (The "Smart" but Flawed Redirect - What's happening now)**
1.  A user (who is not logged in) gets a link to a protected backend API, `http://localhost:8080/protected`.
2.  They click it. They are sent to Google, they log in, and they are correctly redirected back to `http://localhost:8080/protected`.
3.  **The Problem**: What does the user see on their screen? They see a plain white page with only the text: `"Hello, [Your Name]!..."`. There is no UI, no navigation bar, no CSS. The user is now "stuck" on our backend API and is no longer inside our beautiful React application.

#### **Scenario 2 (The Professional Redirect - What we want)**
1.  A user is inside our React app (`http://localhost:5173`) and clicks on a "Dashboard" link.
2.  The React app sees they are not logged in and sends them to our backend to start the Google login process.
3.  They log in with Google.
4.  Our custom `successHandler` then **forces** a redirect back to our React app's dashboard: `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`.
5.  **The Result**: The user is always inside our React application. After login, they land on the beautiful, fully-rendered dashboard page. The user experience is seamless and consistent.

The `SavedRequest` feature is a great tool for monolithic applications (like with Thymeleaf) where the backend also serves the UI. For a decoupled application (API + React), we must take control of the redirect to ensure the user always lands back in the frontend application.
