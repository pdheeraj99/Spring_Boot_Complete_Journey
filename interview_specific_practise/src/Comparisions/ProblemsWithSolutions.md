Of course. Here is a complete summary of the multithreading problems we've discussed, in Markdown format.

# Multithreading Problems & Solutions: A Summary

---

## 1. Memory Visibility Problem

### The Problem
One thread's changes to a shared variable are not seen by other threads. This is due to each CPU core having its own local cache, which can become out-of-sync with the main Heap memory.

* **Analogy**: Priya keeps looking at her own outdated sticky note instead of the main whiteboard that Anil has just updated.

### The Solution: `volatile`
The `volatile` keyword forces all reads and writes for a specific variable to go directly to main memory, bypassing any local CPU cache. This guarantees that all threads always see the most up-to-date value.

* **Code Example**: `VolatileSolution.java`

## 2. Atomicity Problem (Race Condition)

### The Problem
An operation that appears to be a single step (like `count++`) is actually a multi-step sequence (read -> modify -> write). If two threads execute this sequence at the same time, their actions can interleave, leading to lost updates and corrupt data.

* **Analogy**: Priya and Anil both read the number `50` from a tally counter. Priya updates it to `51`. Anil, still working with the `50` he read, also updates it to `51`. An increment is lost.

### The Solution: `synchronized`
The `synchronized` keyword acts as a lock (mutex). It ensures that only one thread can execute a block of code or a method at a time, making the entire operation atomic and preventing interference.

* **Code Example**: `SynchronizedSolution.java`

## 3. Deadlock

### The Problem
Two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for a lock that the other thread is holding. This creates a "circular wait" and freezes a part of the application.

* **Analogy**: Priya holds the Blue Key and waits for the Red Key. Simultaneously, Anil holds the Red Key and waits for the Blue Key. They are stuck forever.

### The Solutions
1.  **Consistent Lock Ordering (Prevention)**: The best and most common approach. All threads must acquire locks in the same globally defined order. This makes a circular wait impossible.
2.  **`tryLock` with Timeout (Avoidance)**: Using `ReentrantLock`, a thread tries to acquire a lock for a specific duration. If it fails, it releases any locks it currently holds and can retry later. This avoids a permanent freeze.

### Code Examples
* `DeadlockSolution.java` (for lock ordering)
* `ResilientTryLockSolution.java` (for the `tryLock` with retry pattern)

## 4. Producer-Consumer Problem

### The Problem
Threads need to coordinate access to a shared, fixed-size buffer. A "Producer" thread adds items, and a "Consumer" thread removes them. The challenge is to make them wait *efficiently* when the buffer is full (for the Producer) or empty (for the Consumer), without wasting CPU cycles in a busy-waiting loop.

* **Analogy**: Anil the Baker (Producer) must wait if the cookie tray (buffer) is full. Priya the Packer (Consumer) must wait if the tray is empty.

### The Solution: `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`
These methods, used inside a `synchronized` block, provide a mechanism for efficient thread coordination.
* `wait()`: Causes a thread to go to sleep and release its lock.
* `notify()` / `notifyAll()`: Wakes up one or all of the threads that are waiting on the same object's lock.
